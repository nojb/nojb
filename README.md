I make a living writing OCaml at [LexiFi](https://www.lexifi.com), in Paris.

Previously, I worked as a mathematician in the US and the UK.

I am active in the [OCaml](https://ocaml.org) community, as a core developer of the [OCaml compiler](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml) as well as a maintainer of the [Dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune) build system. Addtionally, I am a member of the [OCaml Language Committee](https://github.com/ocaml/RFCs/blob/master/Committee.md) and of the executive committee of the [OCaml Software Foundation](https://ocaml-sf.org/).
