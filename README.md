I make a living hacking OCaml at [LexiFi](https://www.lexifi.com) in Paris.

Previously, I worked in academia as a mathematician in the US and the UK.

I am active in the [OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml) community, as a member of the development team of the OCaml compiler and the [Dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune) build system.
