I make a living writing OCaml at [LexiFi](https://www.lexifi.com), in Paris.

Previously, I worked as a mathematician in the US and the UK.

I am active in the [OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml) community, am a core developer of the OCaml compiler and a member of the OCaml Language Committee. I am also a member of the developer team behind the [Dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune) build system.
